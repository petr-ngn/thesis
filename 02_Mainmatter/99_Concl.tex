\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

\textbf{TBD}

Recap of theoretical background (credit risk definition, ML terminology, ML algorithms, evaluation and other topics).

Hypotheses and literature review

Recap of the ML framework and repository structure / Dataset description / findings from distribution and association analysis.

Data preprocessing - data split, ADASYN, optbinning.

Bayesian Optimization - approach -> Feature selection algorithm

Model selection algorithm - ranking, weights, youden index, distribution analysis, final model

recalibration for evaluation -> evaluation / model performance + model explainability

model deployment - web application / application form / prediction result / local explainability

Hypotheses results + key findings + future recommendations
