\chapter{Literature Review}
\label{chap:three}

In this thesis, we examine the studies pertaining to machine learning applications in credit scoring, as well as studies addressing the wide range of machine learning implementations outside the credit scoring domain. The intent is to highlight certain machine learning techniques from non-credit scoring contexts that may be applicable to credit scoring and inspect whether they have positive or negative impact which will be further assessed within hypotheses testing.
In the context of the studies related to machine learning in credit scoring, we inspect not only the studies focusing on the data set analyzed in this thesis, but we aksi  also about the studies encompassing analyses of variety of distinct datasets.
This inclusive approach is emplopyed to foster a more comprehensive and holistic understanding of the subject and to enable the identification of potentially valuable insights and methodologies that can be applied across different datasets within the credit scoring field.

\section{Hypotheses}

\noindent \textbf{Hypothesis 1:} The recalibration of the model enhaces model performance \citep{de2023predicting}.

\textbf{TBD}

\noindent \textbf{Hypothesis 2:} The Neural Network model outperforms all the models.

\textbf{TBD}

\noindent \textbf{Hypothesis 3:} Black--box models perform better than the white--box models.

\textbf{TBD}

\noindent \textbf{Hypothesis 4:} The longer execution time of a model, the better performance \citep{wu2018accurate}.
